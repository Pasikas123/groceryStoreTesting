# 🧪 Simple Grocery Store API testing

## 📝 Project Description

This project contains API tests created using Postman and Newman for the [Simple Grocery Store API](https://github.com/vdespa/Postman-Complete-Guide-API-Testing/blob/main/simple-grocery-store-api.md).  
The goal of the project is to validate key functionalities of the API, such as user authentication, product retrieval, cart operations, and order management.

All tests were organized using Postman collections and environment variables for better maintainability and flexibility. The project demonstrates how to structure API tests effectively and execute them both manually and via CLI using Newman.
